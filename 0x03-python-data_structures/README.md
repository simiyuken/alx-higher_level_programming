## Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Learning Objectives

## General

* Why Python programming is awesome
* What are lists and how to use them
* What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
* What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
* How to use lists as stacks and queues
* What are list comprehensions and how to use them
* What are tuples and how to use them
* When to use tuples versus lists
* What is a sequence
* What is tuple packing
* What is sequence unpacking
* What is the del statement and how to use it

## Tasks

## Print a list of integers

Write a function that prints all integers of a list.

* Prototype: `def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):`
* Format: one integer per line. See example
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You can assume that the list only contains integers
* You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
* You have to use `str.format()` to print integers

## 1. Secure access to an element in a list

Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.

* Prototype: def element_at(my_list, idx):
* If idx is negative, the function should return None
* If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return None
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You are not allowed to use try/except

#!/usr/bin/python3
element_at = __import__('1-element_at').element_at

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
idx = 3
print("Element at index {:d} is {}".format(idx, element_at(my_list, idx)))

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x03$ ./1-main.py
Element at index 3 is 4
